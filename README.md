# RL Implementations 

A collection of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms implemented as part of a structured 6-week learning plan.  

### Week 1: Core Concepts
- RL basics: agent, environment, state, action, reward  
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)  
- Value functions and Bellman equations  

### Week 2: Tabular Value-Based Methods
- Policy evaluation & improvement  
- Monte Carlo vs Temporal Difference learning  

### Week 3: Q-Learning & SARSA
- Q-learning (off-policy) vs SARSA (on-policy)  
- Exploration–exploitation trade-off  

### Week 4: Policy Gradients
- Policy gradient theorem  
- REINFORCE algorithm  

### Week 5: Actor–Critic
- Combining value and policy learning  
- Advantage functions  

### Week 6: Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Function approximation & large state spaces  
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN): experience replay, target networks
